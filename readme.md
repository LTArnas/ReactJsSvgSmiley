# Template/Builerplate Project for ReactJS

The idea it's ready-made to start work, except for things that are per-project.
E.g. see package.json

- You are expected to 'npm init'. The package.json provided is just to pre-define some common packages.
- Don't forget to 'npm update'.

- Assumed file structure is part of the boilerplate. Basic sample files are in there.

- Assumed that you have typings installed globally.

-------
steps:

- 'git init'
- 'git pull [this repo]'
- 'npm init'
- 'npm update'
- 'typings install'
- ...umm, done.
